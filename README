## JUnit4Android
JUnit4Android is an Android library project to build Android test runner applications for running JUnit4 and JUnit3 tests and test suites.
The Android development tools come with a TestRunner that can only run JUnit3 tests. JUnit4Android is useful, if you have existing JUnit4 tests
and want to run them on the Android platform. However JUnit4Android also executes JUnit3 tests, so you are free to mix all versions together.
